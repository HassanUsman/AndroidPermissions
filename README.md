            }
        });

````

**Multiple permissions:**
```java
Permissions.check(this, new String[]{Manifest.permission.CAMERA,
                Manifest.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE},
        "Camera and storage permissions are required because...", new Permissions.Options()
                .setSettingsDialogTitle("Warning!").setRationaleDialogTitle("Info"),
        new PermissionHandler() {
            @Override
            public void onGranted() {
                //do your task
            }

 * Dialog messages and texts can be modified by building the options parameter.
